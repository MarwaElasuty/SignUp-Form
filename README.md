React components & JSX

Props & component reusability

Handling user input & events

Two-way data binding

State management with React Hooks (useState)

Conditional rendering

Dynamic & conditional styling

Component composition & modular structure

Combining Vanilla CSS, Tailwind CSS, and styled components

# Built With

React

Vite

JavaScript (ES6+)

Tailwind CSS

CSS / Styled Components

# How It Works

The user enters email and password.

Inputs are managed via state using useState.

Invalid inputs (missing @ in email or password < 6 characters) trigger conditional styling and error indicators.

Components update dynamically based on user interaction and validation state.

The project demonstrates how to combine multiple styling approaches and modular component structure in React.
